## Featured Projects

### [Loan Approval Prediction App](https://loh-0-loan-approval-prediction-streamlit-app-dsy9mv.streamlit.app/)
- Built a fully interactive **Streamlit web app** to predict loan approvals using a Random Forest model.
- Integrated **SHAP** explainability tools to visualise individual prediction reasons and feature impacts.
- Designed a **What-If simulator** to explore how improving CIBIL scores or reducing loan amounts could improve approval chances.
- Highlighted data limitations: model mainly relied on CIBIL score and loan term due to limited feature influence.

### [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/loh-0/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)
- Developed supervised learning models on 250,000+ transactions to identify fraud.
- Used **SMOTE** to balance the data and improve recall of fraudulent classes.
- Evaluated with confusion matrix, increased true positive rate by 11%.

### [Betting and Strategy Model with Markov Chains](https://github.com/loh-0/Markov-Chain-Based-Betting-and-Strategy)
- Extended the Snakes and Ladders board game into a **Markov Chain simulation** with stochastic player types.
- Used Monte Carlo simulation & heuristics to optimise betting strategy and maximise wins.

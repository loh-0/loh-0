## Featured Projects

### [Loan Approval Prediction App](https://loh-0-loan-approval-prediction-streamlit-app-dsy9mv.streamlit.app/)
- Built a fully interactive **Streamlit web app** to predict loan approvals using a Random Forest model.
- Integrated **SHAP** explainability tools to visualise individual prediction reasons and feature impacts.
- Designed a **What-If simulator** to explore how improving CIBIL scores or reducing loan amounts could improve approval chances.
- Highlighted data limitations: model mainly relied on CIBIL score and loan term due to limited feature influence.

### [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/loh-0/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)
- Developed supervised learning models on 250,000+ transactions to identify fraud.
- Used **SMOTE** to balance the data and improve recall of fraudulent classes.
- Evaluated with confusion matrix, increased true positive rate by 11%.

### [Betting and Strategy Model with Markov Chains](https://github.com/loh-0/Markov-Chain-Based-Betting-and-Strategy)
- Developed betting strategy optimisation using Markov Chains and simulated annealing, improving win rates from 45% to 96% by modeling stochastic transitions between financial states
- Conducted Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000+ iterations to validate analytical results and analyse probability distributions for different starting conditions and strategies
- Applied matrix exponentiation and absorption probability calculations to determine expected outcomes and time-to-absorption across different balance states in a discrete stochastic system
- Built transition matrices and implemented optimisation algorithms to solve strategy selection problems, demonstrating quantifiable performance improvements through statistical analysis

### [Stock Trading Simulator](https://trading-sim-rho.vercel.app/)
- Built a full-stack **paper-trading simulator** using **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB Atlas**.
- Simulates real-time NASDAQ trading using **Finnhub API** for live stock prices.
- Features include **portfolio tracking**, **buy/sell flow**, profit/loss calculations, and position management.
- Backend hosted on **Render**, frontend on **Vercel**, with configs handled via **environment variables**.
- Designed a professional UI with responsive layout, animated notifications, and smart error handling.
